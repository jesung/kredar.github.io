Hi there! I am Art Kreimer, a technical product leader with over a decade of experience leading cross-functional teams to bring digital products to life. I have a Bachelor's degree in Communication Systems Engineering and have worked across various industries, including ASIC, Consumer Electronics, Telecom, web and mobile apps, Machine Learning and Conversational AI, and Finance.

I'm passionate about Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Conversational AI and truly enjoy using these technologies to solve customer problems. As a Principal Product Manager at Scotiabank, I drive product strategy and development, working closely with my team to bring innovative products to market. Before joining [Scotiabank](https://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/personal.html), I was a key player in the development of Conversational AI and Chatbot Analytics platforms at [Wysdom.AI](https://wysdom.ai/).

I live in Ontario, Canada, with my wife, two daughters, and Hungarian Vizsla. I love spending my free time with my family and enjoying outdoor activities like hiking, running, and exploring nature. I am also an avid reader and lifelong learner.

Feel free to [contact](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kreimer/) me if you find my blog useful, think I might be a good fit or simply would like to connect.

I love to read, and I read a lot. When I was younger, I was mostly reading fantasy and sci-fi books. But about ten years ago, it all changed when I read my first nonfiction book. I don't remember why but I read "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, and I loved it. It was easy to read, had great true-life stories, and I saw that it could change my own life. I couldn't stop talking about it; I talked about it with my family, friends, and coworkers. I have to admit - it didn't change my life but definitely affected it and got me thinking about good and bad habits in my life and how to control them. Later I read several of Malcolm Gladwell's books and liked them. Nowadays, I mostly read nonfiction books and mostly around product management ( I am going to write a separate post on books for PMs), leadership, management, and psychology. 

I have divided this books list into three categories: 

**Inspirational/Self-help** are books that you read and get inspired to do more, to do something bigger. In this category, you would find biographies, memoirs, self-development books, and some inspirational novels. 

**Leadership/Management** are books on the art of leading people & teams and managing projects.

**Know the past** - These are history books. As [Carl Sagan](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/194992-you-have-to-know-the-past-to-understand-the-present,) famously said, "You have to know the past to understand the present." I would add to it, "You have to know the past to understand the present and build a better future." 

## **Leadership/Management**

- [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.ca/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884/ref=sr_1_1?crid=137EWJSQBHXZZ&dchild=1&keywords=high+output+management&qid=1627681414&sprefix=high+outpu%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-1) by Andy Grove

  Andy Grove was one of the greatest CEOs of our time, and his management approach is a foundation of famous OKRs (Objective Key Results). A must-read book for any manager. 

- [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.ca/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building/dp/0062273205/ref=sr_1_1?crid=39TD4QUJOA6LV&dchild=1&keywords=hard+things+about+hard+things&qid=1627681454&sprefix=hard+things+%2Caps%2C185&sr=8-1) by Ben Horowitz

  Ben Horowitz has co-founded Andreessen Horowitz - one of the most prominent Silicon Valley investment firms. His book contains lessons learned from founding, running, and selling a company for $1.6B. It covers all the hards things about running the company, including leading and firing people, building the right culture, and the difference between Peacetime and Wartime CEOs. Running a company is a very tough, stressful job but can be extremely rewarding, and it's something you can learn. 

- [Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.amazon.ca/Trillion-Dollar-Coach-Leadership-Playbook/dp/0062839268/ref=sr_1_1?crid=18Q9Y4Q5VVNXW&dchild=1&keywords=trillion+dollar+coach&qid=1627681480&sprefix=trillion+do%2Caps%2C179&sr=8-1) by Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, Alan Eagle

  Coaching is a must-have skill for any manager, and Bill Campbell was probably one of the best business coaches. He coached leaders from Google, Apple, Intuit, and many other companies. He was a great coach, community builder, and just a great human being, and we all can learn from his legacy. If you aspire to become a great leader, you should read this book.

- [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.ca/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/1847941494/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OVHNXSFLDV5J&dchild=1&keywords=never+split+the+difference&qid=1627681538&sprefix=never+sp%2Caps%2C181&sr=8-1) by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz

  We have to constantly negotiate something, be it in the office or at home. In his book, Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, provides insights and clear guidance everyone can apply to everyday negotiations. I am not going to say that after reading this book, I can win at every negotiation, but I am working on it üòÜ

- [Measure What Matters](https://www.amazon.ca/Measure-What-Matters-Google-Foundation/dp/0525536221/ref=sr_1_1?crid=38B44P9BPJVDN&dchild=1&keywords=measure+what+matters&qid=1627681583&sprefix=measure+what+%2Caps%2C173&sr=8-1) by John Doerr 

  Objectives and Key Results is a different approach to goal-setting used by hundreds of successful companies worldwide. The most famous of them is Google. John Doerr introduced OKRs to Google founders back in 1999, and OKRs are an integral part of Google's success. If you want your organization to excel, aim high, and move fast, you have to read about OKRs. 

- [Rework](https://www.amazon.ca/Rework-Jason-Fried/dp/0307463745/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=rework&qid=1627681603&sr=8-1) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson

  A lot of controversial thoughts and bits of advice in this book. You can read more about it in this [post]({% post_url 2021-02-14-Rework-book-review %})

[comment]: <> (- [Good to Great]&#40;https://www.amazon.ca/Good-Great-Some-Companies-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=sr_1_1?crid=TKBOSJ9K5Y35&dchild=1&keywords=good+to+great&qid=1627682140&sprefix=good+to+great%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-1&#41; )
 

## Inspirational/Self motivation 

- [Steve Jobs](https://www.amazon.ca/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501127624/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=steve+jobs&qid=1627681628&sr=8-1) by Walter Isaacson

  Steve Jobs was one of the most outstanding CEOs of our time. His managerial style was not great, but he led the creation of multiple life-changing products that forever changed our lives. A must-read. 

- [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.amazon.ca/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/006230125X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=elon+musk&qid=1627681654&sr=8-1) by Ashlee Vance

  Sometimes it seems whatever Elon Musk is touching turns into gold. Every company he is involved with succeed. But it doesn't come as easy as it looks. He is probably one of the smartest and hard-working CEOs I read about. Another must-read. 

- [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.ca/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/0385669763/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=power+of+habit&qid=1627681677&sr=8-1) by Charles Duhigg and [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.ca/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GQFFE2F9R8H7&dchild=1&keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1627681696&sprefix=atomic+ha%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1) by James Clear

  Both books cover a fascinating topic of human habits. Most of what we do in our day-to-day lives are habits. Habits do not require deep thinking and are being stored in a different part of our brain.  If you want to understand and be able to control your habits, check out these two books. I would recommend reading at least of them. 

- [Educated](https://www.amazon.ca/Educated-Tara-Westover/dp/1443452483/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=educated&qid=1627681717&sr=8-1) by Tara Westover

  "Educated" is a memoir of a Mormon girl who, despite childhood hardships and never attending school, was able to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. An unbelievable true story of perseverance, hard work, mental struggles, and different family values. It's a book that you wouldn't be able to put down. You might also want to check the audiobook - great performance and pleasure to listen to. 

- [Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.ca/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279/ref=sr_1_1?crid=MSZPMRL5NAB7&dchild=1&keywords=cant+hurt+me&qid=1627681746&sprefix=cant+h%2Caps%2C239&sr=8-1) by David Goggins

  David Goggins is a crazy MF. He shares his incredible life story in his book and challenges what we believe our bodies can do. He claims that we are using only 40% of our capabilities, and through hard work and dedication, we can achieve much more. I would also recommend checking the audiobook. It has additional info and interviews with the author. 

- [Mindset](https://www.amazon.ca/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mindset&qid=1627681765&sr=8-1) by Carol C Dweck

  In her book, Carol C Dweck divides people into two categories. People with a fixed mindset - those who believe that our abilities are fixed and can't change them, and people with a growth mindset - believe that we can develop any abilities if we spent enough time. The fixed mindset is limiting and not letting us develop and achieve better things in life. With the Growth Mindset, we can grow ourselves and motivate and inspire people around us. 

- [Quiet](https://www.amazon.ca/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=quiet&qid=1627681785&sr=8-2) by Susan Cain

  I never knew about the concept of introverts and extroverts. And definitely, I didn't know that I am an introvert. So who are these two types of people? What is the difference between their personalities? What are their strength and weaknesses? How can introverts succeed in a world that value extroverted behaviors? You are going to find answer's in Susan Cain's book. Highly recommend.

- [I Can't Make This Up](https://www.amazon.ca/Cant-Make-This-Up-Lessons/dp/1501155571/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1627681810&sr=8-1) by Kevin Hart

  Great entertaining and inspirational book on not giving up and pursuing your dreams. Listen to the audiobook narrated by Kevin Hart himself. 

- [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.amazon.ca/Almanack-Naval-Ravikant-Wealth-Happiness/dp/1544514212/ref=sr_1_1?crid=GQSR6W29O2KS&dchild=1&keywords=naval+ravikant&qid=1627681835&sprefix=naval+ra%2Caps%2C185&sr=8-1) by Eric Jorgenson

  Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur, philosopher, and investor. He is well known for his principles on building wealth and creating happiness in our lives. This book is a collection of Naval's posts, twits, interviews, and podcasts. Check it out to learn more on how to build happier, wealthier life

- [Outliers: The Story of Success](https://www.amazon.ca/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3I08X4MM1STPQ&dchild=1&keywords=outliers&qid=1627681927&sprefix=outlie%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-1) by Malcolm Gladwell

  Outliers are the best and brightest, and most successful. Malcolm Gladwell shares the secrets of best and brightest and what it takes to become One. The famous quote of `10,000 hours of **practice** to master a skill` is from this book. 



## Know the past

### [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.ca/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0771038518/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1SQUHAY7LP7UU&dchild=1&keywords=sapiens&qid=1627681863&sprefix=sapiens%2Caps%2C202&sr=8-1) by Yuval Noah Harari
  
![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZhK-cIjmL._SY264_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg){: .align-left} How Homo Sapiens became the most dominant species on the planet Earth? What happened to other human species that lived on planet Earth alongside Home Sapiens? Why do we live in the most peaceful time of human history? Yuval Noah Harari masterfully covers these and other questions about the history of humankind in his book. If you like Sapiens, I would suggest checking his other book, "[Home Deus](https://www.amazon.ca/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0771038704/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3GU6DG985YR2C&dchild=1&keywords=homo+deus&qid=1627681880&sprefix=homo+%2Caps%2C203&sr=8-1)," where he predicts how humans would evolve and what the future holds for us. 


### [The Tipping Point](https://www.amazon.ca/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tipping+point&qid=1627681906&sr=8-1) by Malcolm Gladwell

  ![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31R-U1dkyKL._SY264_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_ML2_.jpg){: .align-left} The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, or social behaviour crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Why do ideas spread like epidemics and what part does the Tipping Point play? What sort of people have the most influence on the spread of ideas? Which of the factors play a part in the spread of ideas? Answers to this and other questions will be covered in Malcolm Gladwell's book.

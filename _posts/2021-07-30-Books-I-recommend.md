I love to read. When I was younger, I was mostly reading fantasy and sci-fi books. It all changed when I read my first nonfiction book. I don't remember why, but I read "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, and I loved it. It was easy to read, had great true-life stories, and I saw that it could change my own life. I couldn't stop talking about it; I talked about it with my family, friends, and coworkers. I have to admit - it didn't change my life but definitely affected it and got me thinking about good and bad habits in my life and how to control them. Later I read several of Malcolm Gladwell's books and liked them. Nowadays, I mostly read nonfiction books and mostly around product management ( I am going to write a separate post on books for PMs), leadership, management, and psychology. 

I have divided this list into three categories: 

**Inspirational/Self-help** are books that you read and get inspired to do more, to do something bigger. In this category, you would find biographies, memoirs, self-development books, and some inspirational novels. 

**Leadership/Management** are books on the art of leading people & teams and managing projects.

**Know the past** - These are history books. As [Carl Sagan](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/194992-you-have-to-know-the-past-to-understand-the-present,) famously said, "You have to know the past to understand the present." I would add to it, "You have to know the past to understand the present and build a better future."

### [Trillion Dollar Coach](https://amzn.to/3vHjUVi) by Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, Alan Eagle     

 ![Trillion Dollar Coach](/assets/images/trillion_dollar.jpg){: .align-left} Coaching is a must-have skill for any manager, and Bill Campbell was probably one of the best business coaches. He coached leaders from Google, Apple, Intuit, and many other companies. He was a great coach, community builder, and just a great human being, and we all can learn from his legacy. If you aspire to become a great leader, you should read this book.

### [Never Split the Difference](https://amzn.to/3OvfsS9) by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz    

![Never Split the Difference](/assets/images/never_split_the_diff.jpg){: .align-left} We have to constantly negotiate something, be it in the office or at home. In his book, Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, provides insights and clear guidance everyone can apply to everyday negotiations. I am not going to say that after reading this book, I can win at every negotiation, but I am working on it üòÜ

### [Measure What Matters](https://amzn.to/3EGylgn) by John Doerr

John Doerr introduced OKRs to Google founders back in 1999, and OKRs are an integral part of Google's success. If you want your organization to excel, aim high, and move fast, you have to read John Doerr's book.

### [Rework](https://amzn.to/3uzqHB7) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson   

![Rework](/assets/images/rework.jpg){: .align-left} "‚ÄúRework‚Äù is not your typical business book. It‚Äôs a quick read - a collection of small ideas/tips on Entrepreneurship, Productivity, Management, Marketing, Hiring, Business Culture, and more. The beauty of ‚ÄúRework‚Äù is that it forces you to 'Think Again' about what you thought you knew about productivity, management, and marketing. You can read more about it in this [post]({% post_url 2021-02-14-Rework-book-review %})

## Inspirational/Self motivation   


### [Steve Jobs](https://amzn.to/37GT8Ew) by Walter Isaacson  

![Steve Jobs](/assets/images/steve_jobs.jpg){: .align-left} Steve Jobs was one of the most outstanding CEOs of our time. His managerial style was not great, but he led the creation of multiple life-changing products that forever changed our lives. A must-read.

### [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://amzn.to/3OB2y5f) by Ashlee Vance   

![Elon Musk:](/assets/images/elon_musk.jpg){: .align-left} Sometimes it seems whatever Elon Musk is touching turns into gold. Every company he is involved with succeed. But it doesn't come as easy as it looks. He is probably one of the smartest and hard-working CEOs I read about. Another must-read.

### [The Power of Habit](https://amzn.to/3k1svgl) by Charles Duhigg and [Atomic Habits](https://amzn.to/3K7BKGo) by James Clear   

![Habit](/assets/images/power_habit.jpg){: .align-left} Both books cover a fascinating topic of human habits. Most of what we do in our day-to-day lives are habits. Habits do not require deep thinking and are being stored in a different part of our brain.  If you want to understand and be able to control your habits, check out these two books. I would recommend reading at least of them.

### [Educated](https://amzn.to/3OydzUS) by Tara Westover  

![Educated](/assets/images/educated.jpg){: .align-left} "Educated" is a memoir of a Mormon girl who, despite childhood hardships and never attending school, was able to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. An unbelievable true story of perseverance, hard work, mental struggles, and different family values. It's a book that you wouldn't be able to put down. You might also want to check the audiobook - great performance and pleasure to listen to.

### [Can't Hurt Me](https://amzn.to/3xOCBt5) by David Goggins   

![Can't Hurt Me](/assets/images/cant_hurt_me.jpg){: .align-left} David Goggins is a crazy MF. He shares his incredible life story in his book and challenges what we believe our bodies can do. He claims that we are using only 40% of our capabilities, and through hard work and dedication, we can achieve much more. I would also recommend checking the audiobook. It has additional info and interviews with the author.    
    
{:style="clear: left"}

--------    
   
### [Mindset](https://amzn.to/3k2ZDUO) by Carol C Dweck   

![Mindset](/assets/images/mindset.jpg){: .align-left} In her book, Carol C Dweck divides people into two categories. People with a fixed mindset - those who believe that our abilities are fixed and can't change them, and people with a growth mindset - believe that we can develop any abilities if we spent enough time. The fixed mindset is limiting and not letting us develop and achieve better things in life. With the Growth Mindset, we can grow ourselves and motivate and inspire people around us.

### [Quiet](https://amzn.to/3xMoLXU) by Susan Cain

And definitely, I didn't know that I am an introvert. So who are these two types of people? What is the difference between their personalities? What are their strength and weaknesses? How can introverts succeed in a world that value extroverted behaviors? You are going to find answer's in Susan Cain's book. Highly recommend.

### [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://amzn.to/3Lk539S) by Yuval Noah Harari   

![Sapiens](/assets/images/sapiens.jpg){: .align-left} How Homo Sapiens became the most dominant species on the planet Earth? What happened to other human species that lived on planet Earth alongside Home Sapiens? Why do we live in the most peaceful time of human history? Yuval Noah Harari masterfully covers these and other questions about the history of humankind in his book. If you like Sapiens, I would suggest checking his other book, "[Home Deus](https://amzn.to/3KdUvIg)," where he is trying to predict how humans would evolve and what the future holds for us.

### [The Tipping Point](https://www.amazon.ca/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=tipping+point&qid=1627681906&sr=8-1) by Malcolm Gladwell  

![The Tipping Point](/assets/images/tipping_point.jpg){: .align-left} The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, or social behaviour crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Why do ideas spread like epidemics and what part does the Tipping Point play? What sort of people have the most influence on the spread of ideas? Which of the factors play a part in the spread of ideas? Answers to this and other questions will be covered in Malcolm Gladwell's book.

# The Future of Conversational AI

I recently discussed the current state of Conversational AI and its future. It was a great discussion, and I thought to share some of it here. But first, let's talk about what is Conversational AI? 

**Conversational AI** is a combination of various tools, frameworks, and machine learning models that allow humans to interact with the technology using natural language. It could be a chatbot on a website or social messaging app, a smart speaker like Amazon Echo, or Conversational IVR in the telephony system. In other words, Conversational AI can communicate like a human by recognizing speech or text, understanding human's intent,  and responding in a way that mimics human conversation.

The best Conversational AI offers an experience that is indistinguishable from a conversation with a human. Only several chatbot implementations claimed that they passed the Turing Test[^2], but they are more of a Smalltalk, ie, chitchat bots. 

Conversational AI or chatbots is not something new. The first chatbot, [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA), was created back in 1966. But only in the last decade we saw a massive investments, advancements as well as interest in Conversational AI and its applications in enterprise organizations.  

## Conversational AI use cases

There are many reasons why companies want to add a conversational AI interface to their products, from providing better customer support to replacing old IVR[^3] systems with a smart IVR. Any interface where customers can interact with a brand can be enhanced or even transformed with Conversational AI. Companies can add Conversational capabilities to the website, mobile app, social pages, and phone systems. Some would argue that Conversational AI is a table stake[^tablestake].

Here are some of the more obvious use cases for conversational AI:

1. Customer Support
2. E-commerce
3. Lead generation
4. General inquiries
5. Info collection
6. Product Education and On-boarding 
7. Personal Financial Management

Companies can also use it internally to improve their employees' experience:

1. On-boarding
2. IT Helpdesk
3. HR support
4. Workflow automation
5. Customer Support Agent assistance and coaching

Like with any product you are building, focus on customer experience. Make sure you define customer-centric KPIs to guide you during the platform selection, UX design and solution architecture. 

## Conversational AI architecture

Enterprise Conversational AI implementation would include multiple components, ML models and services. Here are some of them: 

- Text to Speech
- Speech to Text also known as ASR[^ASR]
- Natural Language Understanding 
- Natural Language Generation
- Conversation Dialog management 
- Telephony System
- Live Chat platform
- Business logic automation and/or RPA[^rpa]

And high-level architecture would look like this:

### Build vs Buy

Building the whole conversational AI stack would be a huge project, and I wouldn't recommend doing it. Many components became a commodity. I would suggest buying most of the components available on the market and only develop what is unique to your organization. When choosing a conversational ai platform make don't forget about:
- Platform maturity and flexibility 
- Hosting flexibility 
- Pricing 
- Scalability 
- Integration with Livechat providers 
- Accessibility 
- Analytics
- And many other features 

To complicate things even more, there are so many Conversational AI platforms available on the market. And each one of them has their pros and cons. Here are some of the most popular platforms:

### Talent

Deciding on a platform is not enough; without people to design, implement and maintain your Conversational experience, your project will fail. You would need a team of professionals to build and optimize your Conversational AI product. At the very least, you would need the following experts in various capacities throughout the project:

- Conversational UX designers
- Conversational AI developers
- NLP trainers
- Data Analysts and Data Scientists
- Software developers
- Machine Learning developers

So why we don't see a chatbot on every enterprise website? The answer is simple - Conversational AI is complex and requires substantial investment to implement it properly - from choosing the right conversational AI platform to getting the right talent to implement, and monitor and optimize the experience. 

To summarize, implementing Conversational AI is not an easy task and implementing great conversational UX is even more complicated. Lack of talent is a major reason why many of the enterprise companies don't have conversational AI implementations. There some courses and Many companies are working on training conversational ux designers, bot developers 

## The Future of Conversational AI

COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation in general and pushed companies to accelerate their efforts in adding Conversational AI solutions to their websites, IVRs, social channels, etc. When there is a demand, there is a supply. A new startup popped up specializing in Conversational AI tools and frameworks. And investors were fast to make significant investments in Conversational AI startups[^investments]. 

At the same time, big players (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, IpSoft, Nvidia) continue to invest heavily in their Conversational AI offers and acquire or invest in startups and AI research companies[^msft_invest]. 

With all the capital investments and latest breakthroughs in NLP/NLU space(ASR[^asr], NLP[^4], TTS[^TTS]), new courses specializing in conversational UX design[^convdesign] and more and more professionals investing in their conversational AI skills we are about to see more and more enterprise virtual assistants and conversational IVRs. I expect that in 5 years, every enterprise will have conversational AI implementation on their website, mobile app, social channel, and internal virtual assistants. Having Conversational AI already considered a table stake[^tablestake], and in 5 years, it will be everywhere. 

I also envision simplification and enhancements of conversational AI tools:

-   Simplified NLP training that requires less training data 
-   Pretrained domain-specific NLP models 
-   Conversational templates
-   Truly self-learning capabilities, like information extraction from previous conversations and model adjustments
-   Adoption of codex like capabilities - translation of human language to a code[^codex]. It would greatly simplify bot development.
-   More professionals with conversational AI skills 

  

Conversational AI is quickly evolving, and we are about to see a lot of innovations in this space and great Conversational AI implementations. It feels great to be part of this evolution, and I look forward to experiencing it.


[^codex]: I was especially impressed by the OpenAI's [Codex demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGUCcjHTmGY). Codex is a GPT-3 based model that can translate human language into a programming code. Imaging that you don't have to write a code to retrieve information from the database but all you have to do is to train ML model on your enterprise APIs, so when customer asks `what is my balance?` model translated this into a code and retrieve this information.

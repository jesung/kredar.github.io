I like to read, and I'm often asked for Product Management book recommendations. There are a lot of great books to read out there ( check out my post on must-read books), but what are the must-reads for any PM. 

Recently I have found this great post with a visual guide on [Delibr](https://www.delibr.com/post/visual-guide-to-the-best-books-on-product-management). I think it's a great step-by-step visual into PM books. But I think it doesn't cover all books.

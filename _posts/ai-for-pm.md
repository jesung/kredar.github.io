# Introduction

Since OpenAI released ChatGPT last November LLMs, GPTs, Gen AI have become buzzwords and everyone is talking about it.  In many cases people are mixing AI with Gen AI and simplifying LLMs and their capabilities by calling them AI (thanks God they are not calling them AGIs). Every enterperises suddenly started to invest money and talent into exploring LLMs and Gen AI models. In this article I would like to demystify some concepts about Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning and their applications. I'm not an AI expert by all means but I know enough to be confident enough to talk about these topic - I did a Deeplearning.AI specialization, build some ML models from scrats, lead team of ML engineering and Data Scientists and constantly tinkering with data. 

# Definitions

Let's start with definitions to make sure we are talking about the same thing. AI can stand for many Assist

>  **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** is a computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence.
>
> **Machine Learning (ML):** is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to make decisions or predictions.
>
> **Deep Learning:** is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn and identify patterns from large amounts of data.
>
> **Generative AI:** a deep learning models that can generate new data or content, such as images, music, video or text.
>
> **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):** AI system with human-level intelligence that can perform various tasks across different domains without specific programming.



The history of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence dates back to the mid-20th century. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where the groundwork for the field was laid. Early AI research focused on problem-solving and symbolic methods, with the belief that AI could be achieved by manipulating symbols. Machine Learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a distinct field in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The focus of Machine Learning is to enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. The advent of the internet and the explosion of digital data drove the development of more sophisticated Machine Learning algorithms. Today, AI and Machine Learning are at the forefront of technological advancements, driving innovations in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.

As you can see 

ML applications can be devided into several categories:

1. Supervised Machine Learning
2. Unsupervised Machine Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning
4. 

# Applications 

AI/ML is not something new. 



ML models have been used for a quite some time now. 

- **Personalization** - Use customer data to personalize experiences: treatment plans, learning, semantic search, marketing.
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identification of unusual patterns or deviations from the norm.
- **Recommendation Systems** - Personalized recommendations for products, services, or content in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media.
- Image Recognition - The process of identifying an object or a feature in an image or video.
- **Customer Insights** - Derive insights from customer feedback, reviews, behaviours…
- **Predictive analytics** - Forecast customer behaviour, churn, sales…
- **Content Generation** - Generate text, images, videos, voice, code…
- Customer Support - Chatbots capable of answering customer inquiring and providing customer support 24/7.

I'm often asked for product management book recommendations. There are a lot of great books to read out there ( check out my post on general must-read books), but what are the must-reads for any PM?

I recently found this great post with a visual guide on [Delibr](https://www.delibr.com/post/visual-guide-to-the-best-books-on-product-management). I think it's a great step-by-step visual into PM books. But I think it doesn't cover all books.

Here is my list of 25 essential books for PM at any level:

### [Never Split the Difference](https://amzn.to/3OvfsS9) by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz    

![Never Split the Difference](/assets/images/never_split_the_diff.jpg){: .align-left} We have to constantly negotiate something, be it in the office or at home. In his book, Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, provides insights and clear guidance everyone can apply to everyday negotiations. I am not going to say that after reading this book, I can win at every negotiation, but I am working on it ðŸ˜†

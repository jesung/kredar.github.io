Every day we process tons of information. Almost every day, we learn new concepts and make hundreds of small and big decisions. We are constantly using our brains; we are always thinking. So how can we improve our thinking process? How can we understand new concepts faster, and how can we make better decisions in our daily life?
These are the questions I asked myself a while ago. I was trying to find a way to learn new concepts faster. I started researching and stable upon a blog about the abundance of data (an information overload) and a suggestion to prioritize the information we consume and build better mental tools. The idea is simple - build more and better mental models. But what is a mental model?
A mental model is a pattern, a representation or an explanation of how something works. You see, our brain works by constantly creating patterns - models of understanding - of how things work. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. Whether we realize it or not, we use these models daily to think, make decisions, understand new concepts, and find solutions to our problems. Each of us has hundreds, if not thousands, of mental models. There are probably millions of mental models, some true and some false, but you don't have to know them all. You need to build a collection of good mental models. 

So let's review some of them to understand better what they are.

## The Map is not the territory  
Anything that is trying to model something else can't be accurate because it's not an actual thing.

## The Pareto principle 
The Pareto principle or 80/20 rule states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes.

## First Principles Thinking
There are many methods and tools to get to the solutions, but the principles are few. People who understand the fundamental principles can use any technique or develop their methods. But people who blindly use methods without understanding the underlying principles are bound to make mistakes. Ask yourself why you think this way. 5 Whys is one of the tools that can be used to dig deeper to understand the underlying principles.

## Second-Order Thinking 
We can anticipate the immediate results of our actions - first-order thinking. Second-order thinking is thinking further ahead subsequent effects of those actions.
Let's look at two areas where second-order thinking can be used to great benefit:
   Prioritizing long-term interests over immediate gains
   Constructing effective arguments
We don't make decisions in a vacuum, and we can't get something for nothing. When making choices, considering consequences can help us avoid future problems. We must ask ourselves the critical question: And then what?

## Occam's Razor 
The essence of Occam's Razor, a classic principle of logic and problem-solving, is that simpler explanations are more likely to be the right ones than a complicated ones. Instead of wasting your time trying to disprove complex scenarios, you can make decisions more confidently by basing them on the explanation with the fewest moving parts.

## Hanlon's Razor 
Hanlon's Razor states that we should not attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity. In a complex world, using this model helps us avoid paranoia and ideology.


We covered just some of the most known mental models and as you can see, mental models are useful tools that can improve your thinking, help you learn new concepts faster and help you make better decisions in your daily life.
So what can you do next to take your thinking process to the next level:
Explore fs.blog and their books
Practice mental models
When facing a complex concept deconstruct it to simple principles
All of us can make better decisions daily if we build a library of great mental models.
